        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul id="ingredients">
            <li>3 cups Burgundy wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brandy</li>
            <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>10 whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 pounds cubed beef chuck roast</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>¼ pound bacon, cubed</li>
            <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol id="steps">
            <li>For marinade: In a large bowl, combine the wine, cognac, onions, carrots, parsley, bay leaf, garlic, peppercorns and salt. Mix well and add the cubed beef. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <li>For Bourguignon: Strain the meat from the vegetables and marinade; reserve marinade. Dry meat with paper towels. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the meat and saute for 10 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Transfer meat to a separate medium bowl with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add the bacon and saute until lightly browned. Transfer the bacon to the bowl with the meat. Drain the skillet and return it to the heat. Pour a cup of marinade into the skillet to deglaze the skillet, scraping the bottom to loosen up all the little bits. Return this liquid to the reserved marinade.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add the onion and carrot from the marinade, along with the additional onion that you've chopped, and saute for 5 minutes, or until tender. Transfer this mixture to the bowl with the meat and bacon, again using a slotted spoon, and return skillet to the heat. Add the flour to the skillet, combining with the oil and stir until well mixed and brown, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 6</li>
            <li>Now add the tomato paste, garlic, beef broth, reserved marinade and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and whisk to remove any flour lumps. Add this to the meat and vegetable mixture. Place entire mixture into a 9x13 baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 3 hours, stirring occasionally and adding water as needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>About 15 minutes before meat is done baking, melt butter in the skillet over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. When meat is done, add the mushrooms to the meat mixture, stir well and let sit for about 15 minutes.</li>
